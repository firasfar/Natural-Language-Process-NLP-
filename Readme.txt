####About Dataset
What's In The Deep-NLP Dataset?
Sheet1.csv contains 80 user responses, in the responsetext column, to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'.  User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.

Sheet2.csv contains 125 resumes, in the resumetext column. Resumes were queried from Indeed.com with keyword 'data scientist', location 'Vermont'. If a resume is 'not flagged', the applicant can submit a modified resume version at a later date. If it is 'flagged', the applicant is invited to interview.

What Do I Do With This?
Classify new resumes/responses as flagged or not flagged.

There are two sets of data here - resumes and responses. Split the data into a train set and a test set to test the accuracy of your classifier. Bonus points for using the same classifier for both problems.

Good luck.

There Is A 'deep natural language processing' Kernel. I will update it. I Hope You Find It Useful.
You can use any of the code in that kernel anywhere, on or off Kaggle. Ping me at @_samputnam for questions.
